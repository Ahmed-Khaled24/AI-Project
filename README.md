# Gobblet AI Player
# Description
In this project, we will explore the game-playing of Gobblet, Gobblet is an abstract game
played on a 4x4 grid with each of the two players having twelve pieces that can nest on
top of one another to create three stacks of four pieces.
Your goal in Gobblet is to place four of your pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
row. Your pieces start nested off the board. On a turn, you either play one exposed
piece from your three off-the-board piles or move one piece on the board to any other
spot on the board where it fits. A larger piece can cover any smaller piece. A piece
being played from off the board may not cover an opponent's piece unless it's in a row
where your opponent has three of his color.
Your memory is tested as you try to remember which color one of your larger pieces is
covering before you move it. As soon as a player has four like-colored pieces in a row,
he wins â€” except in one case: If you lift your piece and reveal an opponent's piece that
finishes a four-in-a-row, you don't immediately lose; you can't return the piece to its
starting location, but if you can place it over one of the opponent's three other pieces in
that row, the game continues..

  ## Assumptions
   1. The game assumes that the RED pieces always start first.
   2. In the Human VS AI mode, the AI plays with the black pieces, and the human player plays with the RED pieces.
  ## Features 
  The Game has three modes to choose from:
    -**Human VS Human**: 
     This mode provides a multiplayer experience where two human players can play against each other. 
    -**Human VS AI**: 
     In this mode, a human player can play against an AI. The difficulty level and algorithm used by the AI can be selected.
    -**AI VS AI**: 
     This mode allows users to observe the gameplay between two AI opponents. The difficulty level for each AI player can be adjusted.

  ## Algorithms Used 
    - Minimax algorithm: This algorithm explores all possible moves and evaluates the board state to make optimal decisions.
    - Alpha-beta pruning: This algorithm enhances the minimax algorithm by reducing the number of nodes evaluated, resulting in faster decision-making.
    - Alpha-beta pruning iterative deeping: This algorithm further improves the alpha-beta pruning by performing iterative deepening, which allows for more efficient searching of the game tree.
   ## Difficulty levels
   The game supports two difficulty levels:
   - Easy: This level has a depth of 2 in the search tree, making it less challenging for players.
   - Hard: This level has a depth of 5 in the search tree, providing a greater challenge for players. At this level, the AI is expected to make more optimal moves and can be difficult to beat.

## Project Creation with Miniconda or Anaconda:

**Download Miniconda or Anaconda**:
   Visit the [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) website and download the installer for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux). Choose the Python 3.x version.


### Managing `requirements.txt` in a Python Project

This guide provides steps for dealing with the `requirements.txt` file in your Python project, including its creation and updates.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Before starting your project, consider creating a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv /path/to/requirements.txt
   ```
   Make sure to replace /path/to/requirements.txt with the actual path to your requirements.txt file.
2. **Activate the Conda Environment:**
    Activate the environment using the following command:
    ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    ```
3. **Verify Environment Creation:**
    You can verify that the environment has been created and that the packages specified in requirements.txt have been installed:
    ``` bash
    conda list
    ```
4. **Update Dependencies:**
    Whenever you install any packages using `pip` or `conda` 
    make sure to update `requirements.txt` file using:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    And commit the changes to `Github`
5. **Update existed env:**
    If you already have created the enviroment and need to update it from the `requirements.txt` file using this command:
    ```bash
    conda install --file path/to/requirements.txt
    ```
6. **Deactivate the Envirement:**
    deactivate the env when you're done:
    ```bash 
    conda deactiavte
    ```
